# AiiDA-MatDis

You may find three types of AiiDA WorkChains in this
repository.

* WorkChains which are developed by myself.
* WorkChains which have been developed on top of ones developed by other collaborators and
researchers for the purpose of my research but are provided here due to considerable deviation from
original design.
* Information about other WorkChains from other groups which we are using for out research .

**NOTE**: Documentation for each WorkChain including the references, sources, know-hows, etc are provided in
the Wiki.
